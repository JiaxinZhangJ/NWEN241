# NWEN241
The assignments for 241 which using C and C++ 
In this repositories, it includes all the assignment I did for NWEN 241, most of the code are written in c. And libraries I used 
are only works on ECS machine, which is operating on Linux. 
If you want to use Windows or any other operating system you need to changed the library also some codes maybe. 
Most codes are coded in C. Most assignments I got over 95% except the first one that one only got around 75%. 

And one last thing but most important thing, DONT just copy and paste it for your own assignment, that makes no good for your
own education. You are more than welcome to have a look and understand it.
